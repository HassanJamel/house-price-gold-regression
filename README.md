# House Prices Prediction: Advanced Regression Techniques

## 📝 Project Description

This project aims to predict house prices (SalePrice) using the Ames Housing dataset. This is a classic Kaggle competition that requires advanced data cleaning, feature engineering, and regression modeling. We perform extensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), handle missing data, and implement machine learning models like XGBoost, LightGBM, and Gradient Boosting.

## 📊 Economic Analysis

- **Rising House Prices**: Driven by low mortgage rates, inventory shortages, and increasing urbanization.
- **2026 Forecast**: Prices are expected to stabilize but maintain a slight growth trend (estimated 2-4% annual growth) in Q1 and Q2.
- **Future Declines**: Potential interest rate hikes and increased housing supply could lead to localized price corrections in 2027.


## 🏆 Kaggle Requirements

### Why is this dataset useful?

It provides 79 explanatory variables describing almost every aspect of residential homes in Ames, Iowa, making it perfect for practicing advanced regression.

### What is the goal?

Predict the final price of each home. For each Id in the test set, you must predict the value of the SalePrice variable.

### Metrics

Submissions are evaluated on **Root-Mean-Squared-Error (RMSE)** between the logarithm of the predicted value and the logarithm of the observed sales price.
